# Fresh Tomatoes
This app generates an HTML page which displays movie posters of the Best Picture Oscar winners of the 21st century. Clicking on a film will play its trailer in a modal.

## Usage
### 1. Install dependencies.
Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if you haven't already. (Either Python 2 or Python 3 works for this application.)

### 2. Clone the repository.
In a terminal, navigate to the folder you want this project copied to, and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/steve-mcclellan/fresh-tomatoes.git
```

### 3. Run the code.
Navigate into the newly-created `fresh-tomatoes` folder, and run the main program file:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```
This will generate the HTML file (`fresh_tomatoes.html`) and open it in your default web browser.

Enjoy!
